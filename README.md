## Observable Trends
- The data/scatterplots confirm our beliefs that cities closer to the equator have higher average temperatures.  What was surprising to me was that temperatures seemed to max out around the 20 degree latitude mark.  I would have thought the equator would have had the highest temperatures.

- I didn't see any correlation between cloudiness and humidity as the plots were scattered randomly across all latitudes.

- In terms of wind speed, I could not come to a definitive conclusion; however, I does appear that cities closer to the equator have a greater cluster of low wind speeds.  As we move further away from the equator, the scatters seem to spread over a larger variety of wind speeds.
